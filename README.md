## Usage
This is a very simplistic note taking application. It will start on the homepage, so just click on the "Get Started" button to enter the application. 

The title of any previously saved notes will be visible on the left side of the screen. Enter the title of the note and the body of note before clicking the saved button which looks like a disk. Clicking on a saved note will display the note body in the viewing window. To create a new note, click on the edit pencil. To delete a saved note, click on that note's trash can icon. Click on the Note Taker header in the menu bar to return to the homepage at any time.
